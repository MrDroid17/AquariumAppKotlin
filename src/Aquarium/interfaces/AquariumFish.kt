/***
 * Abstract and interfaces
 *
 *  They can contain declarations of abstract methods, as well as method implementations.
 *  What makes them different from abstract classes is that interfaces cannot store state.
 *  They can have properties but these need to be abstract or to provide accessor implementations
 *
 *  Both are classes that can't be instantiated on their own
 *
 *  difference :
 *  Abstract classes can have constructor but interfaces can not have
 *  any  constructor logic
